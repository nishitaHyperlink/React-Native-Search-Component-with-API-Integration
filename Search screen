This component provides an interactive search experience in a React Native application, incorporating API calls to fetch search results and manage recent searches. 
It uses Axios for handling API requests, AsyncStorage for data storage, and React Navigation for navigating between different screens based on user interactions. 
The component efficiently manages state and renders search results dynamically based on user input.

ðŸ‘‰ Overall Functionality  
When the component mounts, it fetches recent searches from the server.
As the user types in the search bar, search results are fetched and displayed.
Clicking on a search result saves it to the server, updates the recent searches, and navigates to various detail screens based on the clicked item.
The search bar includes clear and search functionalities, and the UI updates dynamically based on user interactions.
